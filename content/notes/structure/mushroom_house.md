## Configuration

Mushroom Houses are setup like any other Minecraft structure so can be modified via [Data Pack](notes/config/datapack). 

Mushroom Houses will generate in any biome with the `biomemakeover:has_structure/mushroom_house` biome tag.

Mushroom House loot is generated from a loot table found in `data/biomemakeover/loot_tables/mushroom_house.json`.
