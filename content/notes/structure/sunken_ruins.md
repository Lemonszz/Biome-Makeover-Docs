## About

Sunken Ruins were added with the [Swamp](notes/makeover/swamp) makeover.
They are Witch inhabited buildings that are sunken into the ground.

The ruins are primarily made out of [Willow Wood](notes/block/willow_wood)

## Mobs

### Enemies
The following enemies spawn in the sunken ruins and do not respawn
- Witches

## Loot
Some unique loot that can be found in the mansion is:
- [Antidote](notes/item/antidote)
- [Witch Hat](notes/item/witch_hat)
- [Bottle o' Lightning](notes/item/bottle_o_lightning)
- [Swamp Jives Music Disc](notes/item/discs)

As well as other Witch-related items from Vanilla Minecraft.

## Configuration

Sunken Ruins are setup like any other Minecraft structure so can be modified via [Data Pack](notes/config/datapack). 

Sunken Ruins will generate in any biome with the `biomemakeover:has_structure/sunken_ruins` biome tag.

Sunken Ruins loot is generated from a loot table found in `data/biomemakeover/loot_tables/sunken_ruin.json`.
