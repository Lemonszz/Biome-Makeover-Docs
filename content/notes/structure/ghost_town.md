## About

Ghost Towns were added with the [Badlands](notes/makeover/badlands) makeover.  

Buildings within Ghost Towns are primarily made up of Terracotta and [Terracotta Bricks](notes/block/terracotta_bricks).

## Mobs
[Ghosts](notes/mob/ghost) spawn in dark areas of the Ghost Town. 

## Loot

### Barrels
Some unique loot that can be found in the Ghost Town barrels are:
- [Cowboy Hat](notes/item/cowboy_hat)
- [Ghost Town Music Disc](notes/item/discs)

### Bookshelves
Chiseled Bookshelves in the Ghost Town have a chance to be filled with either regular Books or Enchanted  Books of various levels.

### Suspicious Red Sand
The streets and some buildings have a chance of containing Suspicious Red Sand, which can contain some of the following unique loot:
- [Ghost Town Music Disc](notes/item/discs)
- [Refined, Whinny and Worker Pottery Sherds](notes/item/pottery_sherds)
- [Cracked Brick](notes/item/cracked_brick)
- [Crude Fragment](notes/item/crude_fragment)


## Configuration

Ghost Towns are setup like any other Minecraft structure so can be modified via [Data Pack](notes/config/datapack). 

Ghost Towns will generate in any biome with the `biomemakeover:has_structure/ghost_town` biome tag.

Ghost Town loot is generated from  loot tables found in `data/biomemakeover/loot_tables/ghost_town/`.
