## About

Ghost Towns were added with the [Badlands](notes/makeover/badlands) makeover.

## Mobs
[Ghosts](notes/mob/ghost) spawn in dark areas of the Ghost Town. 

## Loot
Some unique loot that can be found in the mansion is:
- [Cowboy Hat](notes/item/cowboy_hat)
- [Ghost Town Music Disc](notes/item/discs)

As well as other items from Vanilla Minecraft

## Configuration

Ghost Towns are setup like any other Minecraft structure so can be modified via [Data Pack](notes/config/datapack). 

Ghost Towns will generate in any biome with the `biomemakeover:has_structure/ghost_town` biome tag.

Ghost Town loot is generated from  loot tables found in `data/biomemakeover/loot_tables/ghost_town/`.
