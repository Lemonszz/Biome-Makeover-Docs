## Configuration

The Woodland Mansion is setup like any other Minecraft structure so can be modified via [Data Pack](notes/config/datapack). 

The Woodland Mansion rework will generate in any biome with the `biomemakeover:has_structure/reworked_mansion` biome tag.

Mansion loot is generated from loot tables found in `data/biomemakeover/loot_tables/mansion`.
