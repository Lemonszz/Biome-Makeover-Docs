Ivy was added with the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.

It can be naturally found growing on [Ancient Oak](notes/generation/ancient_oak) trees and on [Woodland Mansions](notes/structure/mansion).

Ivy can be placed on any side of a block.

It will spread out over time.

Ivy can be harvested with Shears, giving you 1 Ivy block for each side it is attached to.
