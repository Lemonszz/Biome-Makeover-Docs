Peat was added with the [Swamp](notes/makeover/swamp) makeover.

It comes in two forms, Mossy Peat and Peat.
It generates in the Swamp biomes and has several uses.

## Uses
- Peat can be dried in a furnace to receive [Dried Peat](notes/block/dried_peat), a furnace fuel and decorative block
- Peat can be tilled into [Peat Farmland](notes/block/peat_farmland), a fast growing farmland alternative.

## Generation
Peat generates in patches inside Swamp biomes

It generates in shallow areas of water underneath dirt, with Mossy Peat sticking up through the ground.

## Creation  
Peat can be created by using Pointed Dripstone.

If a **full** Composter is underneath Pointed Dripstone that is dripping Water, there is a chance that the Composter contents will transform into Peat.  

A composted that is full of Peat will give off a comparator signal of 9.
