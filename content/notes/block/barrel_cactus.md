Barrel Cactus was added with the [Badlands](notes/makeover/badlands) makeover.

It is found throughout the Badlands biomes and comes in two variants - flowered and unflowered.

Overtime, the unflowered variant will grow flowers.

[Scuttlers](notes/mob/scuttler) will target and eat Flowered Barrel Cactus, causing the cactus to become unflowered and dropping [Pink Petals](notes/item/pink_petals).  

Barrel Cactus can be used as food for Camels.
