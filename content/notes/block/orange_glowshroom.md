Orange Glowshrooms were added with the [Mushroom Fields](notes/makeover/mushroom_fields) makeover.

They can be naturally found under the water surrounding the Mushroom Fields biome.  
New Orange Glowshrooms can be generated when [Bonemealing Mycelium](notes/mechanic/mycelium_bonemealing) underwater.

Bonemealing the Mushrooms will generate [Huge Orange Glowshrooms](notes/generation/huge_glowshrooms)

They are used in the recipe for [Glowshroom Stew](notes/item/glowshroom_stew).
