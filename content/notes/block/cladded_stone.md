Cladded Stone was added with the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.

Cladded Stone is used in the construction of [Stone Golems](notes/mob/stone_golem).

It is crafted with [Crude Cladding](notes/item/crude_cladding) and Smooth Stone. You may also find Cladded Stone in some rooms of the [Mansion](notes/structure/mansion).
