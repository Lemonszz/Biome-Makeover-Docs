Itching Ivy was added with the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.

It can be naturally found growing on the canopy of Dark Oak trees, spreading from [Moth Blossoms](notes/block/moth_blossom). 

Walking through a Itching Ivy block will slow movement by 50%.

Itching Ivy can be placed on any side of a block.

Like [Ivy](notes/block/ivy), it will spread out over time.  
Using Bonemeal on Itching Ivy will turn it into a [Moth Blossom](notes/block/moth_blossom) block.

Itching Ivy can be harvested with Shears, giving you 1 Itching Ivy block for each side it is attached to.
