Budding Illunite is part of the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.

It can be naturally found in [Illunite Fissures](notes/generation/illunite_fissures). 

Over time, this block will grow new [Illunite Buds](notes/block/illunite_bud) before they fully grow into [Illunite Clusters][notes/block/illunite_cluster].

This block can not be obtained or moved by the Player, but it is available in the creative menu.
