Wild Mushrooms were added as part of the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover, but were retroactively added to the [Mushroom Fields](notes/makeover/mushroom_fields) makeover.  

Wild Mushroom can be broken to receive:
- 0 - 1 Red Mushrooms
- 0 - 1 Brown Mushrooms

If broken with shears, the Wild Mushroom block is dropped.
