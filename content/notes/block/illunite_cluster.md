Illunite Clusters were added with the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.

It can be naturally found in [Illunite Fissures](notes/generation/illunite_fissures) after growing from a [Illunite Bud](notes/block/illunite_bud) or as a reward from [Witch Quests](notes/mechanic/witch_quests)

Breaking will give a [Illunite Shard](notes/item/illunite_shard) which is used for the [Curse Enchanting](notes/mechanic/curse_enchanting) mechanic or for crafting into a [Block of Illunite](notes/block/illunite_block).

A Illunite Cluster can be obtained by breaking it with Silk Touch.


## Mechanics
During the day, the Cluster will not give off any light.

At night, the cluster will turn on, and give off light.

In a dimension without a day/night cycle, the crystal will become inert and turn black.
