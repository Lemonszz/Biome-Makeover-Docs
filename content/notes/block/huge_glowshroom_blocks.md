Glowshroom Blocks generation alongside [Huge Glowshrooms](notes/generation/huge_glowshrooms).  

There is a cap block for each Glowshroom variety, [Purple](notes/block/purple_glowshroom), [Green](notes/block/green_glowshroom) and [Orange](notes/block/orange_glowshroom) as well as the Glowshroom Stem block, that generates with every type.  

They can be Silk Touched to receive the block, or broken regularly to receive their respective Glowshroom.
