Moth Blossom was added with the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.

It can be naturally found growing on the canopy of Dark Oak trees along with [Itching Ivy](notes/block/itching_ivy). 

Walking through a Moth Blossom block will slow movement by 50%. [Moths](notes/mob/moth) are attracted to Moth Blossoms.

Moth Blossom can be placed on any side of a block and will give off particles in that direction.

Like [Ivy](notes/block/ivy) and [Itching Ivy](notes/block/itching_ivy), it will spread out over time.

Moth Blossoms can be harvested with Shears.
