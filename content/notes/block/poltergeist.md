The Poltergeist block was added with the [Badlands](notes/makeover/badlands) makeover.

It can be crafted from [Ectoplasm](notes/item/ghost), Phantom Membranes, Soul Soil and a Cauldron. 

#### Poltergeisting

Like [Ghosts](notes/mob/ghost), the poltergeist can interact with blocks around it these are:
- Doors
- Buttons
- Trapdoors  
- Levers  
- Note Blocks  
- Fence Gates  
- Bells

If a redstone signal is applied to the Poltergeist block, it will be disabled and will not interact with blocks.

It will interact with blocks within a 2 block distance from the center, as shown in this image
