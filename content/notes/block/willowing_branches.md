Willowing Branches were added with the [Swamp](notes/makeover/swamp) makeover.

Willowing Branches are generated as part of [Willow Trees](notes/generation/willow).

They can be harvested with Shears.

Willowing Branches will grow downwards and can be grown with Bonemeal.  

Using Shears on the head of the branch will stop it from growing any further downwards.
