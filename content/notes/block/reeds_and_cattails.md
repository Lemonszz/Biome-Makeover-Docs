Reeds & Cattails were added with the [Swamp](notes/makeover/swamp) makeover.

Reeds & Cattails are two blocks that generate in shallow water of Swamp biomes.

They can be created via [Swamp Bonemealing](notes/mechanic/swamp_bonemealing).

Reeds & Cattails must be broken with Shears to yield themselves as a drop.
