Saguaro Cactus was added with the [Badlands](notes/makeover/badlands) makeover.

It is found throughout the Badlands biomes as a natural plant.

Like regular Cactus, any entity touching the block will be damaged.

### Growing
A single Saguaro Cactus block will naturally grow (or via bonemealing) into a full-sized  Saguaro Cactus plant
