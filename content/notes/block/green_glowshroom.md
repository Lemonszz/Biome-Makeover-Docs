Green Glowshrooms were added with the [Mushroom Fields](notes/makeover/mushroom_fields) makeover.

They can be naturally found in caves under the Mushroom Fields biome.  
New Green Glowshrooms can be generated when [Bonemealing Mycelium](notes/mechanic/mycelium_bonemealing).

Bonemealing the Mushrooms will generate [Huge Green Glowshrooms](notes/generation/huge_glowshrooms.md)

They are used in the recipe for [Glowshroom Stew](notes/item/glowshroom_stew).
