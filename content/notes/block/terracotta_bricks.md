Terracotta Bricks were added with the [Badlands](notes/makeover/badlands) makeover.

Terracotta bricks come in all 16 Minecraft colors, as well as the undyed Terracotta color.  They can be crafted from their Terracotta counterpart or found within [Ghost Towns](notes/structure/ghost_town).  

Terracotta Bricks can be crafted into their slab, stair and wall variants.
