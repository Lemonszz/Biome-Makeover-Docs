Illunite Buds were added with the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.

It can be naturally found in [Illunite Fissures](notes/generation/illunite_fissures), growing on [Budding Illunite](notes/block/budding_illunite).
It will eventually grow into a [Illunite Cluster](notes/block/illunite_cluster).  

Breaking before the bud is mature will not yield anything, unless Silk Touch is used, where it will drop the bud form.

There are 3 stages of bud (small, medium and large) that must grow before becoming an  [Illunite Cluster](notes/block/illunite_cluster)


## Mechanics
During the day, the bud will not give off any light.

At night, the bud will turn on, and give off light.

In a dimension without a day/night cycle, the crystal will become inert and turn black.
