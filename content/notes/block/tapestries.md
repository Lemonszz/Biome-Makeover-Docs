Tapestries were added as part of the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.  

Tapestries are decorative blocks that can be found in rooms of the [Mansion](notes/structure/mansion).  

They come in 16 color variants and 1 unique tapestry dropped by the [Adjudicator](notes/mob/adjudicator).

They can be placed either on the floor in 16 directions or on walls in 4 directions.

Tapestries can not be crafted.
