Suspicious Red Sand was added with the [1.20](notes/changelog/120) update.

It can be naturally found within [Ghost Towns](notes/structure/ghost_town).

Like Suspicious Sand or Gravel, Suspicious Red Sand can be brushed away using a Brush to obtain various items, such as the [Refined, Worker or Whinny Pottery Sherds](notes/item/pottery_sherds).
