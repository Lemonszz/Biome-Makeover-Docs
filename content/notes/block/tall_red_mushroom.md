Tall Red Mushrooms were added with the [Mushroom Fields](notes/makeover/mushroom_fields) makeover.

They naturally grow in small ground within the Mushroom Fields biome.  

Breaking this block without Shears will yield 1-3 Red Mushrooms. Wirth Shears, it will drop itself.

New Tall Red Mushrooms can be created by [Bonemealing Mycelium](notes/mechancic/mycelium_bonemealing).
