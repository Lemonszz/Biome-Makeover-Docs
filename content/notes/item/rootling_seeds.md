Rootling Seeds were added with the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.

Rootling Seeds can be obtained as a drop from [Rootlings](notes/mob/rootling).

Rootling Seeds can be planted like any other seed. Once the crop is mature, a [Rootling](notes/mob/rootling) will sprout out of the ground, removing the crop.
