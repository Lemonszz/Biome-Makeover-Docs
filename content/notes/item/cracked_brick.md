Cracked Bricks were added with the [1.20](notes/changelogs/120) update.

The can be obtained by smelting Bricks in a Furnace or found when brushing [Suspicious Red Sand](notes/block/suspicious_red_sand).

They can be crafted into [Cracked Bricks](notes/block/cracked_bricks) or used within the crafting of [Decorative Pots](notes/item/pottery_sherds) to create a cracked pattern.
