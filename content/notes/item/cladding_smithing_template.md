Cladding Smithing Templates were added with the [1.20](notes/changelogs/120) update.


Cladding Smithing Templates are used, along with [Crude Cladding](notes/item/crude_cladding) to upgrade Leather Armor into [Cladded Armor](notes/item/cladded_armor) within a smithing table. 

They can be obtained as a guaranteed from from Pillager Patrol Leaders and as loot from the Pillager Outpost Chest.

They can be duplicated by crafting them along with an Iron Ingot and [Mesmerite](notes/block/mesmerite).
