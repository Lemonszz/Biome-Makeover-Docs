Bottle o' Lightning were added with the [Swamp](notes/makeover/swamp) makeover.

They are obtained by interacting with a [Lightning Bug](notes/mob/lightning_bug) while holding a Bottle o' Enchanting or by finding them within [Sunken Ruins](notes/structure/sunken_ruins). 

They can be thrown. Any mobs cause in their radius will:
- Act as they were hit by lightning (Creepers will charge, Pigs will become Zombified Piglins, etc.)
- have 50 Seconds of the [Shocked](notes/mechanic/shocked) applied. The level of shocked  is the mobs current shocked level + 1, with a max level of IV.

Bottle o' Lightning can be dispensed through a dispenser.
