Stunt Powder was added with the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.

Stunt Powder can be used on a baby animal to prevent it from growing into an adult.  

It can be obtained by crafting it out of a [Illunite Shard](notes/item/illunite_shard) and a [Bulbus Root](notes/item/bulbus_root).
