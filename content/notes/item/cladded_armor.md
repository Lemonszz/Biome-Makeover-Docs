Cladded Amor was added with the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.

It can be naturally found within [Woodland Mansions](notes/structure/mansion) or crafted with Leather Armor and [Crude Cladding](notes/item/crude_cladding) in a Smithing Table.

Cladded Armor has a [Projectile Resistance](notes/mechanic/projectile_resistance) attribute, giving it a defense stat of 21 against projectile weapons, slightly higher than Diamond Armor's defense of 20.

Like Leather Boots, Cladded Boots allow the player to walk on Powdered Snow.
