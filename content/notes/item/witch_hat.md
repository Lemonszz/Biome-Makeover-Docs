The Witch Hat was added with the [Swamp](notes/makeover/swamp) makeover.

It can be naturally found within [Sunken Ruins](notes/structure/sunken_ruins) or as a rare drop from Witches.

Wearing a Witch Hat causes Witches to become neutral towards the player and allow them to access [Witch Quests](notes/mechanic/witch_quest).
