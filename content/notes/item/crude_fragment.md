Crude Fragments were added with the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.

Crude Fragments can be crafted from [Crude Cladding](notes/item/crude_cladding) or obtained as a drop from Pillagers or [Suspicious Red Sand](notes/block/suspicious_red_sand). 

4 Crude Fragments can be crafted into 1 [Crude Cladding](notes/item/crude_cladding).
