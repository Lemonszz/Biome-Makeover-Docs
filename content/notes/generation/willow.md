Willow Trees were added with the [Swamp](notes/makeover/swamp) makeover.

They generate throughout the Swamp Biome or with [Willow Saplings](notes/block/willow).
The trees can generate on land on in up to 2 deep water.

Willow Trees have hanging [Willowing Branches](notes/block/willowing_branches) that may hang down into the water. 

Willow Trees contain the following blocks:
- [Willow Wood](notes/block/willow)
- [Willow Leaves](notes/block/willow)
- [Willowing Branches](notes/block/willowing_branches)
