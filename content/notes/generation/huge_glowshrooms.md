Huge Glowshrooms were added with the [Mushroom Fields](notes/makeover/mushroom_fields) makeover.

They can either be grown from [Purple](notes/block/purple_glowshroom), [Green](notes/block/green_glowshroom) and [Orange](notes/block/orange_glowshroom) Glowshrooms or the Green and Purple variants may be rarely found underground.

All Huge Glowshrooms have a stem made of [Glowshroom Stem](notes/block/huge_glowshroom_blocks.md) blocks and an appropriatly colored [Huge Glowshroom Block](notes/block/huge_glowshroom_blocks.md) for their cap.  

Only Orange Glowshrooms can be grown underwater.
