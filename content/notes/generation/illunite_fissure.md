Illunite Fissures was added with the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.  
They replaced the original "Mesmerite Boulders" that initially released with the makeover.  

Illunite Fissures are cracks in the ground containing:
- [Mesmerite](notes/block/mesmerite)
- [Budding Illunite](notes/block/budding_illunite)
- [Block of Illunite](notes/block/illunite_block)
- [Illunite Cluster](notes/block/illunite_cluster.md)
- [Illunite Bud](notes/block/illunite_bud)

You may some across some fissures that do not contain any Illunite.
