> - Are you using Forge or Fabric?
> - What Minecraft version are you using?
> - What version of Biome Makeover are you using?
> - Can you recreate the issue?
> - Your `latest.log` file (found in your Minecraft installation folder/logs)
> 

If you think you've found a bug or are running into a crash, please report it and provide the information in the box about.
