## About

Stone Golems are added as part of the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.   

Stone Golems are constucted sentries that will shoot hostile mobs for you.

## Behavior
Player built Stone Golems will shoot a crossbow at any nearby hostile mob.  They can not move, but instead rotate around their base.  

Naturally spawning Stone Golems will attack the player.

When damaged Stone Golems will crack and can be repaired with [Cladded Stone](notes/block/cladded_stone)

## Building
Stone Golems must be constructed out of [Cladded Stone](notes/block/cladded_stone) and a Carved Pumpkin in a cross shape.

## Drops
When killed Stone Golems will drop:
- 2 - 3 [Cladded Stone](notes/block/cladded_stone)
