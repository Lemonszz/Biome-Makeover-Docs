## About

Scuttlers are added as part of the [Badlands](notes/makeover/badlands) makeover.   

## Behavior
Unless tamed, Scuttlers will flee from the player, rattling their tail.   
When fed [Pink Petals](notes/item/buds.md), they have a chance to become friendly and will stop fleeing. They will not follow the player.   

Two friendly Scuttlers can be fed [Pink Buds](notes/item/buds.md) to begin breeding.

When a Scuttler detects a [Flowering Barrel Cactus](notes/block/barrel_cactus), they will walk towards it and eat it, causing a  [Pink Buds](notes/item/buds.md) to be left behind.

## Drops
When killed Rootlings will drop:
- 1 [Scuttler Tail](notes/item/scuttler_tail)
