## About

Marauders were added as part of the [Badlands](notes/makeover/badlands) makeover.   

If a Pillager Patrol was to spawn in the Badlands, Marauders will spawn instead.

Marauders wear [Cowboy Hats](notes/item/cowboy_hat) and ride Horses.  
The Patrol Captain was a special Ominous Banner featuring a Marauder Design.
