## About

The Adjudicator was added as part of the [Dark Forest](notes/makeover/dark_forest) makeover.   

This master of the [Woodland Mansion](notes/structure/mansion) is no easy fight.

## Behavior
The Adjudicator meditates in his study within the [Woodland Mansion](notes/structure/mansion).

Attacking him or placing/breaking any blocks will cause him to wake, beginning his boss fight.

Leaving his boss room will cause the fight to end and the Adjudicator will return to his meditation and begin healing.

During the fight he will summon enemies, teleport around and attack you with a variety of weapons - so be prepared.

## Drops
When killed Rootlings will drop:
- 1 [Adjudicator Tapestry](notes/block/tapestries)
- 1 [Enchanted Totem of Undying](notes/item/enchanted_totem_of_undying)
