Tumbleweed was added as part of the [Badlands](notes/makeover/badlands) makeover.   

It spawns around the biome and will bounce around for a short while before breaking.

### Configuration  
Tumbleweed spawning can be disabled with the `/gamerule BMdoTumbleweedSpawning false` command.  

Tumbleweed will spawn in biomes with the `biomemakeover:spawns_tumbleweed` biome tag.
