## About

Lightning Bugs were added with the [Swamp](notes/makeover/swamp) makeover.

## Behavior
Lightning Bugs are an ambient mob, so they spawn randomly at all times of the day in small groups.

They will float around, following their leader before eventually despawning.

If interacted with a Glass Bottle, they will be captured into a [Lightning Bug Bottle](notes/block/lightning_bug_bottle). 
If interacted with a Bottle o' Enchanting they will be captured into a [Bottle o' Lightning](notes/item/bottle_o_lightning).
