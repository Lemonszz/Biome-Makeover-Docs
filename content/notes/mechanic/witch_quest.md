## About
Witch Quests are a mechanic where a Witch will reward you for delivering certain items. The items are traded in for a random reward.

### Witches 
Witches will only be able to be used for Witch Quests if:
- The player is wearing a [Witch Hat](notes/item/witch_hat)
- The Witch is not part of a Raid

If those conditions are met, the player will not be attacked by the witch and can interact with them to access the quest menu.

If a Witch's quest interface is open, it is protected from despawning for 10 minutes. Naming the Witch with a nametag will still prevent it from despawning.

## Quests

![[notes/images/witch_quests.png]]

Each Witch will have 3 quests that can be completed once. Witches will get new quests every 17 - 20 minutes.

If the player has all the items required for a quest, it will be highlighted in green. 
Clicking on this quest will remove the items from the player's inventory, and give them a random reward.  

Quests have 4 tiers of difficulty:
> Common
> Uncommon
> Rare
> Epic

The quest tier is displayed on the diamond icon next to the quest items.  

The higher the tier, the more likely it is that you will receive a rare reward.


## Rewards
Rewards are divided into four possible tables:  

### Items
This table contains many potion and magic adjacent items.

Some of the unique loot is:
- [Illunite Shard](notes/item/illunite_shard)
- [Swamp Jives Music Disc](notes/item/discs)

### Potion Ingredients  
This table contains large quantities of potion ingredients as well as [Soul Embers](notes/item/soul_embers). 

### Potions
This table contains almost every type of potion including:

- [Potion of the Nocturnal](notes/item/nocturnal_potion)
- [Antidote](notes/item/antidote)

### Special Potions  
This table contains several special [Multi-Potions](notes/item/multi-potions)

## Configuration
