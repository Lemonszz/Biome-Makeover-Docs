Projectile Resistance is an attribute that:  
- Decreases the damage taken from projectiles
- Has a chance to block projectile damage entirely

[Cladded Armor](notes/item/cladded_armor) is currently the only way to obtain this effect in Biome Makeover.

### Resistance 
The projectile resistance value is added to the overall armor projectile value when attacked by a projectile. 

### Blocking
When attacked by a projectile there is a `[projectile protectile value]/30` chance of mitigating the damage entirely.   
A blocking sound is played when this effect is triggered.  

For example, wearing a full set of [Cladded Armor](notes/item/cladded_armor) gives a projectile resistance value of 6. This gives a 6/30 (20%) chance of activating the block effect.
