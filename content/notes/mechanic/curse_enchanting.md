## About

Curse Enchanting is done with an [Altar](notes/block/altar) which can either be found in the [Woodland Mansion](notes/structure/mansion) or crafted.

Curse Enchanting will take one enchantment on an item, increase its level by 1 and add a random curse.

This allows you to get enchantments one level above the regular max such as *Fortune IV* or *Efficiency VI*, as long as you are willing to risk a curse.

With careful planning, you will be able to take advantage of this system.

## How

For a item to be valid for cursing it must:
- Already have an enchantment
- Must not have been cursed in an altar before

Place this item in the top slot of an altar along with an [Illunite Shard](notes/item/illunite_shard), this will begin the cursing process.

Once the process is over, your item will have been cursed, and a random enchantment will have gained 1 level.
