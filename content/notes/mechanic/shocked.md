Shocked is a status effect that will reduce an entity's max health while activate.
When the effect is removed, the max health will be restored.

To obtain this effect, an entity must be in range of a thrown [Bottle o' Lightning](notes/item/bottle_o_lightning) when it lands.

The entity will lose 2 health per level of Shocked.
