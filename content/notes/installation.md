# Recommended Mods

### Recipe Viewer  
To see the recipes of blocks and items we recommend using a recipe viewer mod such as:  

- Roughly Enough Items (REI)  - [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items) | [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei) - Fabric/Forge
- EMI - [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/emi) | [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) - Fabric
- Just Enough Items (JEI) - [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) | [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) - Forge

### KubeJS  
Most of Biome Makeover's configuration is done though [Data Packs](notes/config/datapack).  We recommend using KubeJS's global Data Pack feature for this.
