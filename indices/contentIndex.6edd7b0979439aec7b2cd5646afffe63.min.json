Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Data_pack):  \nThe data pack system provides a way for players to further customize their Minecraft experience. \nData packs can be used to override or add new advancements, dimensions, functions, loot tables, predicates, item modifiers, recipes, structures, tags, damage types, world generation settings, and biomes without any code modification.\n\n\nBiome Makeover is primarily configured via Data Packs.  While this does add some complexity, it also allows for more customization and decreased development time. \n\nBiome Makeover does have a small configuration file, but it will only be used when there is no other solution for configuration.  \n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisite Information\nAs overview will not cover:\n- Creating or Moving files\n- Installing Data Packs\n- JSON formatting\n\nWe suggest reading through the following information provided by the Minecraft Wiki:\n- [Data Pack](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Data_pack) - An overview of Data Packs\n- [Creating a Data Pack](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Creating_a_data_pack) - Information of making your own data packs\n- [JSON](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/JSON) - Information about JSON syntax\n\n### Base Data Pack\nThis is a starting point for your Biome Makeover Data Pack. It contains no configuration files, just the files required for a data pack and the folder structure to customize anything in Biome Makeover.  \n\nYou may delete any of the subfolders you do not use. Please rename the data pack file and information inside the `pack.mcmeta` file.\n\nThis data pack was last updated for Biome Makeover version `1.19.4-1.9.0`, but should still work on future versions.\n\n[Download the Base Pack Here](https://github.com/Lemonszz/Biome-Makeover-Docs/raw/master/notes/config/biomemakeover-example-datapack.zip)\n\n### Biome Makeover's Data\nIf you wish to overwrite or modify Biome Makeover's data, you must know what each data file is.  \n\nThese can either be found within the mod .jar or [on the mod's Github Repository](https://github.com/Lemonszz/Biome-Makeover/tree/HEAD/common/src/main/resources/data).\n\n### Getting Help  \nWe're happy to help, [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/D5bNnw7) and make a thread in the `#configuration` channel. Please only do this after you have attempted for yourself.\n\n## KubeJS\n[KubeJS](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kubejs) is a powerful Fabric/Forge mod that allows you to make scripts to modify the game, this is a very good alternative to Data Packs.\n\nIt also features a \"Global Data Pack\" feature that will load a data pack for any level. This is usually what you will want for modpacks.\n\nCheck out the [KubeJS website](https://kubejs.com/) for more information.\n\n## Helpful Links\n- [Biome Makeover's Data](https://github.com/Lemonszz/Biome-Makeover/tree/HEAD/common/src/main/resources/data).\n- [KubeJS website](https://kubejs.com/)\n- [Data Pack (MC Wiki)](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Data_pack)\n- [Creating a Data Pack  (MC Wiki)](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Creating_a_data_pack)\n- [JSON (MC Wiki)](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/JSON)\n\n## Biome Makeover Configuration\n- 🧹[Custom Witch Quests and Rewards](notes/config/witch_quests)\n- 🏷️[Tags](notes/config/tags)\n- 💰[Loot Tables](notes/config/loot_tables)\n- 🦦[Other](notes/config/other)","lastmodified":"2023-05-22T21:43:12.270498458Z","tags":["config"]},"/notes/config/loot_tables":{"title":"💰 Loot Tables","content":"\n\u003e [!Info] Relative Paths\n\u003e Unless stated otherewise, all paths to loot tables are relative to `data/biomemakeover/loot_tables`.\n\u003e For example `mansion/arrows.json` is located in `data/biomemakeover/loot_tables/mansion/arrows.json`\n\n## Blocks and Entities\n\nLike vanilla, every block and entity has their loot table located at `blocks/[block name].json` \u0026 `entities/[entity name].json`, unless stated otherwise.\n\n### Witch\nAlongside it's vanilla loot table, the witch will also drop from the `entities/witch_hat.json` loot table.\n\n### Pillagers\nAlongside their vanilla tables Pillagers will also drop from either the `entities/pillager_leader_additional.json`  (Patrol Leaders only) or the `entities/pillager_additional.json` table.\n\n## Gameplay Loot Tables\n\n### Scuttler Eating\nWhen a [Scuttler](notes/mob/scuttler) eats a [Flowering Barrel Cactus](notes/block/barrel_cactus), the petals will drop from the `gameplay/scuttler_eating.json` loot table.\n\n### Rootling Shearing\nWhen shearing [Rootlings](notes/mob/rootling), the petals will drop from one of the following color appropriate tables:\n- `gameplay/rootling/blue.json`\n- `gameplay/rootling/brown.json`\n- `gameplay/rootling/cyan.json`\n- `gameplay/rootling/gray.json`\n- `gameplay/rootling/light_blue.json`\n- `gameplay/rootling/purple.json`\n\n## Structure Loot\n\n### Ghost Town\n[Ghost Town](notes/structure/ghost_town) loot is located in:\n\n- `ghost_town/loot_0.json`\n- `ghost_town/loot_1.json`\n- `ghost_town/loot_2.json`\n\n### Woodland Mansion\n[Woodland Mansion](notes/structure/mansion) loot is located in:\n- `mansion/arrows.json`\n- `mansion/dungeon`\n- `mansion/dungeon_good`\n- `mansion/dungeon_junk`\n- `mansion/good`\n- `mansion/junk`\n- `mansion/standard`\n\n### Sunken Ruins\n[Sunken Ruins](notes/structure/sunken_ruins) loot is located in `sunken_ruin.json`\n\n### Mushroom House\n[Mushroom House](notes/structure/mushroom_house) loot is located in `mushroom_house.json`","lastmodified":"2023-05-22T21:43:12.270498458Z","tags":["config"]},"/notes/config/other":{"title":"🦦 Other","content":"\n\nThese data pack features are too small to have their own dedicated pages.\n\n\n## Custom Compostable Items\nOur base library allows you to add compostable items via data pack:\n\nYour .json files should be inserted in the `compostable` folder.

Each category is a collection of possible items for the Witch to request.  \n\nEach category has a **weight**, the higher the weight, the more likely the category will be chosen.\n\nWhen selection and item for a quest, a category is chosen, then an item is chosen at random from that category.  \n\nEach item has a max count, being the maximum amount of that item the Witch will request.\n\nEach item has a **point value**. The total amount of points for a single quest determines the difficulty of the quest, with higher being harder.\n\nHarder quests have a higher chance of a better reward.\n\n- [Biome Makeover's Categories](https://github.com/Lemonszz/Biome-Makeover/tree/HEAD/common/src/main/resources/data/biomemakeover/quest_category)\n\n## New Category\nHere is an example category file, we could call this file `my_cool_category.json`. It will go in the `data/[packname]/quest_category/` directory.  \n```json\n{\n\t\"weight\": 10,\n\t\"requests\": [{\n\t\t\t\"item\": \"minecraft:apple\",\n\t\t\t\"max_count\": 4,\n\t\t\t\"points\": 5\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"item\": \"minecraft:wheat\",\n\t\t\t\"max_count\": 10,\n\t\t\t\"points\": 1\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"item\": \"minecraft:turtle_egg\",\n\t\t\t\"max_count\": 1,\n\t\t\t\"points\": 10\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"item\": \"minecraft:tall_grass\",\n\t\t\t\"max_count\": 4,\n\t\t\t\"points\": 2\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n\nIn this category, we have a **weight** of 10, this is the likelihood that this category would be chosen.  \n\nTo change the rarity of this category, I could set this value to a lower number, `5` would make it twice as rare, while `20` would be twice as common.\n\nEach item has it's own `points` value. This is the number that contributes to the rarity of the item. A higher `points` value item makes the reward more valuable.\n\n## Overwriting a category\nSay you want to remove all the Biome Makeover's default requested items.  You can not delete Biome Makeover's files, so you have to overwrite it. Here you have two options:\n\n### Overwriting the file\nSay we want to remove the `dark_forest.json` category.  \n\nWe create a new file at `data/biomemakeover/quest_category/dark_forest.json` within our data pack.  We then fill this file with our own data. \n\nThis will fully replace Biome Makeover's `dark_forest.json` as they do not get merged.\n\n### Overwrite and Empty\nThe other option is overwriting and emptying a category.  Again, say we want to remove the `dark_forest.json` category.  \n\nWe create a new file at `data/biomemakeover/quest_category/dark_forest.json`. \n\nThis time we fill it with the following:\n\n```json\n{}\n```\n\nThis is an empty JSON object. Biome Makeover will not attempt to load empty categories, effectively skipping it.\n\nWe would then create own own category in `data/[datapack name]/quest_category/my_cool_category.json` and fill it with our own data.\n\n# Rewards\nRewards are the items received for completing a Witch Quest.\n\nRewards are split into \"reward tables\" that get selected based on the **points** of the completed quest.\n\n## New Reward Table\n\nA reward table contains two parts `weights` and `rewards`\n\n### Weights  \nWeights describe the rarity of this table being rolled for a specific quest rarity. A higher weight is more common.  \n\nFor example:\n```json\n\"weights\": { \n\t\"common\": 110,\n\t\"uncommon\": 90, \n\t\"rare\": 0, \n\t\"epic\": 0 \n\t}\n```\n\nThis describes a weights that are likely to be rolled for a common and uncommon quest, but has no chance for a rare or epic quest.\n\n```json\n\"weights\": { \n\t\"common\": 1, \n\t\"uncommon\": 10, \n\t\"rare\": 50, \n\t\"epic\": 100 \n\t}\n```\nThis describes weights that have a very low chance on a common or uncommon quest, but a better chance on rare and epic quests.\n\n### Rewards  \n\nThere are two types of rewards `biomemakeover:item` \u0026 `biomemakeover:potion`.\n\n```json\n{ \n\t\"type\": \"biomemakeover:item\",\n\t\"item\": \"minecraft:fermented_spider_eye\",\n\t\"min\": 6,\n\t\"max\": 20\n}\n```\nThis describes an in item reward that will give `minecraft:fermented_spider_eye` with a minimum count of 6 and a max count of 20.\n\nItems also have an optional `tag`, allowing you to give the item NBT:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"type\": \"biomemakeover:item\",\n\t\"item\": \"minecraft:diamond_sword\",\n\t\"tag\": {\n\t\t\"display\": {\n\t\t\t\"Name\": \"[{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Witchy Sword\\\",\\\"italic\\\":false}]\",\n\t\t\t\"Lore\": [\"[{\\\"text\\\":\\\"A sword once owned by a witch!\\\",\\\"italic\\\":false}]\"]\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\t\"min\": 1,\n\t\"max\": 1\n}\n```\nThis describes a diamond sword with the name \"Witchy Sword\" and the lore \"A sword once owned by a witch!\"\n\n\n```json\n    {\n      \"type\": \"biomemakeover:potion\",\n      \"potion\": \"minecraft:strong_leaping\"\n    }\n```\nThis describes a reward that will give a leaping potion. All potion rewards have a chance to become splash or lingering potions.\n\n### Full Example  \nThis is a cut down version and modified version of the file `data/biomemakeover/quest_reward/items.json`\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"weights\": {\n\t\t\"common\": 110,\n\t\t\"uncommon\": 90,\n\t\t\"rare\": 0,\n\t\t\"epic\": 0\n\t},\n\t\"rewards\": [{\n\t\t\t\"type\":
